The success of our work is incomplete unless we mention the names of our respected teachers who made it possible, whose guidance and encouragement served to beacon light and crowned our efforts with success.\\
\\
\noindent First, I wish to express my sincere gratitude to our guide, Prof. Sonia Kuvelkar, for her patience, and the constant motivation to achieve our goals. Without her support and guidance, this project would not have been possible.\\
\\
\noindent We would also like to extend our gratitude to the Head of the Department, Dr. H.G.Virani for providing us with the required facilities. We wish to acknowledge the help provided by each and every staff member of the Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering Department. I am grateful to all of those with whom I have had the pleasure of working during this projects. Lastly we thank the almighty for keeping us in good health throughout the course of the project and showing us the light whenever needed
