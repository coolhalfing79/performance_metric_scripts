\noindent Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of networks in which both the routers and their interconnects are constrained.  LLN routers typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power). Their interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and instability. Thus these networks use routing protocols such as the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). RPL is a distance vector routing protocol which uses rank of a node to decide network routes, which is calculated using an objective function. This project proposes a new objective function with a combined metric calculated using Fuzzy Inference to dictate the rank of a node. We propose a combined metric Quality based on ETX, Delay, Hop count and Energy in order to select the best path.
