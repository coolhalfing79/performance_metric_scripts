\section{General Conclusion} \label{General Conclusion}
We have designed a new Objective Function(OF) and implemented the same for Low Power and Lossy Networks. The New OF aims to Optimize more than one Network performance metrics. We have used a Fuzzy Inference System(FIS) to combine Hop count, Latency, Expected transmission count and Power dissipation into a unique value called Quality.
\section{Future Work} \label{Future Work}
In our future work, we will try to implement the optimized routing scheme in a heterogeneous wireless sensor network. In Heterogenous WSNs there are two or more different types of nodes. These networks work on the principle of Clustering where a network is organized into groups or clusters where each cluster has a main node called Cluster Head.\\
We will also try to implement other forms of metric combinations (namely lexicographic and additive approaches) and compare their simulation results with those obtained with the fuzzy logic.
